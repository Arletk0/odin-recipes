# odin-recipes
Once again, I'm stepping into the wonderful world of front-end development with the team from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
This project is meant to strengthen my HTML fundamentals and demonstrate my growing skills.  

It's a basic recipe website — built with pure HTML — and serves as a starting point for future improvements and additions.
